The Mood Detector uses computer vision techniques to analyze facial and hand expressions and detect the user's mood. Utilizing OpenCV, the system captures video input from a webcam, processes the visual data, and classifies the user's mood based on detected expressions. Feel free to explore, experiment, and adapt the mood detector for your needs. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to open an issue. Stay tuned for updates as we plan to extend this project with more advanced features and broader applications!
